  	<h2>About this Application</h2>
    <p>The Nuxeo World mobile application lets you view session schedules,
      descriptions, maps, and presenter bios from the palm of your hand, as well
      as live updates from the official Appcelerator Twitter feed.  The Nuxeo World
      mobile application for iOS and Android was forked by the Nuxeo marketing team
      from the CODESTRING application using the Appcelerator Titanium mobile framework.</p>
